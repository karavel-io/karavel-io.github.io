We are a community of enthusiasts working together towards improving the cloud-native world, focusing on aspects such as
Developer Experience, automation, and ease of use.

We do not discriminate, we welcome everyone and anyone with open arms, as long as they share our vision and our values.

Any individual willing to participate in the Project must abide by our [Code of Conduct]. Any unacceptable behaviour will be
investigated promptly and fairly.

If you want to join us, and participate in this wonderful community to share knowledge and meet other fellow cloud enthusiasts,
we'll be very happy to have you! You will find lots of useful resources on our [Community repository], where you will find all
of our public spaces, such as the [user mailing list] or our [Discord server]. You will also find the public discussion forum,
as well as our [Governance model] and contribution guide.

We strive to build a safe and welcoming space for everyone where development and research can thrive for the betterment of
the container and cloud-native world. We are thrilled to have you join us and can't wait to see what cool things you'll be
building in the future!
