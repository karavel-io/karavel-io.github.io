**The Karavel Project** is an open governance community of technologists with the goal of building tools and knowledge in
the **Kubernetes** and cloud-native space.

It hosts different open source projects that aim at simplifying the deployment and operation of Kubernetes-based
platforms and streamlining the delivery of cloud-native apps on **public cloud**, **private clouds** and **bare-metal** environments.

Everyone is welcome to participate, contribute, and help push forward the developer experience of using Kubernetes and
cloud-native infrastructure in production!
